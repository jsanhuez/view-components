## Requirements

* PHP 5.5+ (hhvm & php7 are supported)

## Installation

#### Installing into Existing Project

The recommended way of installing the component is through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

Run following command from your project folder:

```bash
composer require jsanhuez/view-components
```

#### Installing as Stand-alone Project

For running tests and demo-application bundled with this package on your system you need to install it as stand-alone project.

```
composer create-project jsanhuez/view-components
```
This is the equivalent of doing a git clone followed by a "composer install" of the vendors.
Composer will automatically run 'post-create-project-cmd' command and that will call interactive installation.

If you want to use default settings and run it silently, just add `--no-interaction` option.

If you already cloned this repository, or you want to reinstall the package, navigate to the package folder and run `composer create-project` command without specifying package name.

If you are sure that you don't need to reinstall composer dependencies, you can execute only bundled installer: `composer run post-create-project-cmd`

This kind of installation has additional requirements:
* ext-curl
* ext-pdo_sqlite

## Demo Application

This package bundled with demo-application.

Souce code of demos available [here](https://github.com/view-components/view-components/blob/master/tests/webapp/Controller.php)

#### Working Demo

Travis CI automatically deploys web-application bundled with this package to Heroku.

Here you can see working demos: <http://view-components.herokuapp.com/>

*First run may be slow because Heroku shutting down workers when there is no traffic and starts it again on first visit*

#### Running Demo Application Locally

To run it locally, you must install this package as stand-alone project with dev-dependencis.

Then, run web-server from the package directory with the following command:

```
composer serve
```
This command uses web-server bundled with PHP.

Now, open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in the browser (for Windows users it will be opened automatically after starting web-server).

* [Components Overview](https://github.com/view-components/view-components/blob/master/doc/components.md)
